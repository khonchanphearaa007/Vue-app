 For this for fix data static with file jobs.json file in project
1, import jobs form '../../..'
2, const jobs = ref(jobData && jobData.jobs ? jobData.jobs : jobData);
3, console.log('jobs (array):', jobs.value); --> log data optional

-reactive is if you were to use a single object that has each
field inside of it so an object with name, email

-Proxying we have two requests
+ we have one in the (JobView) making it to the single job 
+ we have on in (JobListings) to jobs

Cuz in (JobView) and (JobListings) is have HTTP when deploy 
  wirting 5-10m we need to a Proxy 
  -we add Proxy in file vite.config.js
